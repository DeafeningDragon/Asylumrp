**Quasar Sellix DLC 1.0.5 [18/03/2023] - https://quasar-store.com/**



**RESOURCE INSTALLATION GUIDE**
Installation is quite easy, put the script under qs-scripts in your server.cfg.
Then in `qs-smartphone/config/config.lua`, add the corresponding app so that it appears in the App Store, or by default on the phone.

In case the app still doesn't appear, use `deleteallapps` in your console and restart script.
